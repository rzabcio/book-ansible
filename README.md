Learning Ansible: my workspace for "Ansible: Up and Running 2ed" book
=====================================================================

Just configs and examples from the book.

Firstly, prepare some environment. You have three options:
* Kind cluster - unsuccessfull to create on WSL2 setup.
* Vagrant hosts - unsuccessfull to create on WSL2 setup, also had problems with pure Windows setup.
* GCP - successful, but pricey...

Then just go to ./playbook to, well, play with Ansible (link ./playbook/hosts).
